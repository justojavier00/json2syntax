# Syntax Tree Generator
This Python library generates a syntax tree of a JSON file, which can then be loaded into an IDE when the syntax tree is imported in Python.
# Abstract Syntax Trees
An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing a flag to the built-in function, or using the helper provided in this module
# Usage
To use this library, simply import it into your Python project and call the function that generates the syntax tree. The resulting tree can then be loaded into your IDE.
